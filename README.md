# TDSynaesthesia
Basically a fork of "TDAbleton" building towards our goals.

First of all, after you install TouchDesigner, you should be able to just double click on `Synaesthesia.toe`.  You don't even have to install the TDAbleton part just yet to do this learning.
## Task one: LearnYouHowToRouteOSC
Check out this youtube video.  I realize it's not perfect but here's the goal for learning.
1. Be able to route data from Ableton to a parameter in LX
2. Be able to route data from an arbitrary source (could be LX, could be TouchOSC, etc.) into Ableton.
OSC is two way street.
OK!  Ready.. set.. GO!!!!

### Alternatives

Note that this is not the only route to get data in and out of Ableton.  If something else fits our needs better, great.

Some other possible candidates:
